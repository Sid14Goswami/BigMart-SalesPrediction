# BigMart-SalesPrediction
The objective of this study is to analyze the trend in the sale of item of different outlets based on the data given about each item and outlet. THe classification algorithm used in the study was random forest classification algortihm and prediction model was designed.
In order to find a decent model to predict sales I performed an extensive search of various machine learning models available in R, in particular of those accessible through the caret wrapper. In the end, however models from the h2o package yielded the best results for this task. In particular, deep learning neural networks h2o.deeplearning and gradient boosting regression trees h2o.gbm performd particularly well. An ensemble of various such models, constructed in h2o.Ensemble.R forms the basis of my submission. Here,I used only the 12 most important predictors to avoid over-fitting. To include some features I may have missed with this rather small subset of predictors I supplemented the ensemble with a deep learning neural net using 23 predictors.
This led to a final score of 1079.84968647.
